ANSi space exploration game created for Ludum Dare 38 over a weekend.  
<!--more-->

A dad-joke pun taken too far, "Go Man's Sky" is a retro BBS-Door style ANSi art space exploration game set in a procedural universe written in Go. Created for Ludum Dare 38. Search for the ancient artifact across dozens of procedurally generated planets. Collect fuel to keep your ship running as you jump from sector to sector in search of the ancient artifact.

Apologies to Hello Games, any similarity to proper games of the same genre is done purely in good humour.

This game is a bare-bones prototype primarily as a learning exercise, however if there's interest I may continue to develop and expand on this as time goes on. There are bugs, it's desperately unfinished, but still a bit of fun.
